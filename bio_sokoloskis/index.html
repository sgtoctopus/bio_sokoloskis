                    <em>Jean-Luc Picard</em> was a celebrated Starfleet officer, archaeologist and diplomat who served during the latter two thirds of the 24th century. <em>Picard</em> not only witnessed the major turning points of recent galactic history,
                    but played a key role in them also, from making first contact as captain of the Federation's flagship with no fewer than 27 alien species, including the Ferengi and the Borg.

                    He also became the chief contact point with the Q Continuum, and served as Arbiter of Succession, where he presided over the investiture of Chancellor Gowron. <em>Picard</em> would expose the Romulan Star Empire as backers of his chief
                    rivals, later aiding a Romulan underground movement of dissidents to gain a toehold on the Romulan homeworld.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He continued to serve as captain of the Enterprise-E, the sixth Federation starship to bear the name, until at least 2379.

        <h3>Captain Picard Day</h3>
        <p>
            <em>Captain Picard</em> Day was an annual event held aboard the USS Enterprise-D for the ship's schoolchildren. Activities included a contest, judged by <em>Captain Jean-Luc Picard</em> himself, in which the children created paintings and
            models of the captain. <em>Picard</em> was himself not very fond of the event, as he generally did not respond well to children.</p>
        <p>
            In 2370, a seven-year-old named Paul Menegay won the contest with an orange clay sculpture of the captain's head. Much to <em>Picard's</em> dismay, Commander Riker took great pleasure in the proceedings. For revenge, <em>Picard</em> arranged
            to have a "Commander Riker Day" the following month and planned to enter the competition himself.
