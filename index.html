            <p>
                <strong>Jean-Luc Picard</strong> was a celebrated Starfleet officer, archaeologist and diplomat who served during the latter two thirds of the 24th century. <strong>Picard</strong> not only witnessed the major turning points of recent
                galactic history, but played a key role in them also, from making first contact as captain of the Federation's flagship with no fewer than 27 alien species, including the Ferengi and the Borg.

            <p>
                He continued to serve as captain of the Enterprise-E, the sixth Federation starship to bear the name, until at least 2379.

            <h3>Captain Picard Day</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Captain Picard</strong> Day was an annual event held aboard the USS Enterprise-D for the ship's schoolchildren. Activities included a contest, judged by <strong>Captain Jean-Luc Picard</strong> himself, in which the children created
                paintings and models of the captain. <strong>Picard</strong> was himself not very fond of the event, as he generally did not respond well to children.</p>
            <p>
                In 2370, a seven-year-old named Paul Menegay won the contest with an orange clay sculpture of the captain's head. Much to <strong>Picard's</strong> dismay, Commander Riker took great pleasure in the proceedings. For revenge, <strong>Picard</strong>                arranged to have a "Commander Riker Day" the following month and planned to enter the competition himself.
